I have  just started  using git .so this is  my first upload .
I have  included  some examples  from the  book "A smarter  way  to learn  python by Mark Myers".
There  are some other  examples  that  were  done in our  python class  so I thought I should share.and i wanted to keep a  record  of it too.
Your  are free  to  make  any improvements in the codes given in mypracticeprograms.ipynb file which  is already under  process.
I  have also  built  a code   to  simplify  my building maintenance  bill which is  also  under process. 
Thanks
